RelxillA is complete base on relxill, please see and follow [relxill](http://www.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/~dauser/research/relxill/) for installation and more details.

# The properties of relxillA

RelxillA is an angle-improved relxill-type model which designed for next-generation instrument *NewAthena*/X-IFU and LAD. 

As show in [Huang et al (2025)]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00946](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adf111)), relxillA simply improves the calculation of the emission angle and predicts slightly different spectra with respect to older models.Therefore it does not introduce any new parameter degeneracy. And relxillA can fit well the simulated observations of [Liu et al (2025)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/536/3/2594/7922853).

## Simulation 

! [Residuals of the best-fit models of relxill v2.4, relxill v2.5,
and relxillA of a simulated NewAthena/X-IFU+LAD spectrum of a
bright black hole X-ray binary with spin parameter α = 0.998 and inclination
angle of the disk $θ_{obs}$ = 15 deg. The black color is used for the NewAthena/XIFU data and the red color is for the LAD data.] [figure/simulation.png]
